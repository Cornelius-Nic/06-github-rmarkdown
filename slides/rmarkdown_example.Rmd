# About the song plays data

This is a dataset of how many times I've played each song in my music library, which I got by importing my data and doing a little bit of preliminary data cleaning. 

# Glancing at the data

```{r load data}
songs_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco-evo-thr-2022/05-simple-metrics/hill/song_plays.csv")

head(songs_data)
```

There are a total of `r nrow(songs_data)` songs in the dataset, and a total of `r sum(songs_data$plays)` plays accounted for.

# Plotting the rank-abundance distribution of song plays

```{r}

ggplot(songs_data, aes(rank, plays)) +
  geom_line()

```
