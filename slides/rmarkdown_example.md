# About the song plays data

This is a dataset of how many times Iâ€™ve played each song in my music
library, which I got by importing my data and doing a little bit of
preliminary data cleaning.

# Glancing at the data

``` r
songs_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco-evo-thr-2022/05-simple-metrics/hill/song_plays.csv")

head(songs_data)
```

    ##                          song rank plays
