# Suggested GH workflow

1. AJR/RMD put template files in the appropriate repo for `ecoevotheory2022` - e.g. the `template_Rmarkdown.Rmd` in this repo.
2. Students *fork* the appropriate repo to their accounts, make changes, and push.
3. Students open pull requests to integrate their changes to the `ecoevotheory` repo.
4. AJR/RMD won't merge the PRs but can use the git diffs to quickly see what folks have done. 
5. If everyone has a problem, AJR/RMD can push a fix to the `ecoevotheory2022` repo and everyone syncs their fork to get the update.
